## Overview

Conditional statements in C are used to perform different actions based on specific conditions. They enable decision-making and control the flow of a program.

For example, if a condition is true, a block of code will execute; otherwise, another block may execute.

---

## Why Conditional Statements Are Important

1. **Decision-Making**: Enables programs to adapt based on input or conditions.
2. **Logic Implementation**: Essential for implementing algorithms.
3. **Flow Control**: Controls which part of the code executes in various scenarios.

## Types of Conditional Statements in C

### 1. `if` Statement
The simplest form of a conditional statement. Executes a block of code if the condition is true.

Syntax:
```c
if (condition) {
    // Code to execute if the condition is true
}
```

---

### 2. `if-else` Statement
Executes one block of code if the condition is true and another if it is false.

Syntax:
```c
if (condition) {
    // Code to execute if the condition is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if the condition is false
}
```

---

### 3. `if-else-if` Ladder
Used to test multiple conditions sequentially.

Syntax:
```c
if (condition1) {
    // Code for condition1
} else if (condition2) {
    // Code for condition2
} else {
    // Code if none of the conditions are true
}
```

---

### 4. Nested `if` Statement
An `if` statement inside another `if` statement.

Syntax:
```c
if (condition1) {
    if (condition2) {
        // Code for condition1 and condition2
    }
}
```

---

### 5. `switch` Statement
Tests a variable against multiple values and executes the corresponding block.

Syntax:
```c
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // Code for value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // Code for value2
        break;
    default:
        // Code if none of the cases match
}
```

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Using `if`
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int number = 10;
    if (number > 0) {
        printf("The number is positive.
");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Example 2: Using `if-else`
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int number = -5;
    if (number > 0) {
        printf("The number is positive.
");
    } else {
        printf("The number is not positive.
");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Example 3: Using `switch`
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int choice = 2;
    switch (choice) {
        case 1:
            printf("Option 1 selected.
");
            break;
        case 2:
            printf("Option 2 selected.
");
            break;
        default:
            printf("Invalid option.
");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Practice Exercises

1. Write a program to check if a number is even or odd.
2. Create a program that takes a user's grade (A, B, C, etc.) and prints a message using the `switch` statement.
3. Write a program to find the largest of three numbers using nested `if`.
4. Build a simple calculator using the `switch` statement to perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
