## Key Concepts in Programming

1. **Variables and Data Types**  
   - Store and manipulate data.  
   - Example: `int age = 25;`

2. **Control Structures**  
   - Make decisions and repeat tasks using:
     - `if`, `else`, and `switch` statements.
     - Loops: `for`, `while`, `do-while`.

3. **Functions**  
   - Modularize code into reusable blocks.  
   - Example:
     ```c
     int add(int a, int b) {
         return a + b;
     }
     ```

4. **Input and Output**  
   - Interact with users via console or GUI.

5. **Debugging**  
   - Identify and fix errors in code.
