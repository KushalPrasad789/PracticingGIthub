## Overview

Conditional statements in C are used to perform different actions based on specific conditions. They enable decision-making and control the flow of a program.

For example, if a condition is true, a block of code will execute; otherwise, another block may execute.

## Why Conditional Statements Are Important

1. **Decision-Making**: Enables programs to adapt based on input or conditions.
2. **Logic Implementation**: Essential for implementing algorithms.
3. **Flow Control**: Controls which part of the code executes in various scenarios.

## Types of Conditional Statements in C

### 1. `if` Statement
The simplest form of a conditional statement. Executes a block of code if the condition is true.

Syntax:
```c
if (condition) {
    // Code to execute if the condition is true
}
